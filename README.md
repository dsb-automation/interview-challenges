# interview-challenges

The Automation team at DSB, we are always looking for people to join. If you do
not see an open position on DSB's [job
site](https://www.dsb.dk/om-dsb/job-i-dsb/ledige-job/), but still think you
would be a good fit for Automation, please write to the department head, [Kim
BÃ¸gholt Max Petersen](mailto:kibm@dsb.dk).

At this moment, we have hired for two main positions in DSB:

1. [RPA Developer](./rpa-developer/ChallengeInstructions.md)
2. [Automation Engineer](./automation-engineer/package_deployment_challenge.md)

The correspondingly named challenges apply to the positions we have hired for.
